jTime lets coders make better use of asynchronous callbacks to 
achieve more control over when code gets executed.  It removes the temporal 
straightjackets imposed by traditional procedural and functional 
methodologies.  jTime includes temporal methods that bridge the gap 
between the various timing hacks used in kernel and device driver 
programming and the long period temporal programming in cron. Applications 
of jTime may include:

* Animation
* Simulation
* Dynamic data visualization
* Web searching and scraping
* Music
* Workflow
* Dynamic business logic
* Smart contracts/property
* Monitoring for and processing of security events
* Systems administration (much more temporal variety than cron)
* Network protocols and administration 
* All sorts of other things

jTime runs in both client side (web browsers) and server side (node.js) 
JavaScript, and does not depend on any other libraries. It is licensed 
under a hybrid of the FreeBSD and MIT licenses: i.e. it is non-copylefted 
open source.

jTime is a work in progress. It is currently at a very early beta stage,
and should be used only by experienced programmers.
